[b]Q:[/b]    I see an Error.
[b]A:[/b]    Upgrade to last version of the BOT, Upgrade to last version of the GiftBox.
Check that the BOT is running with out the GiftBox enabled. Can there be harvest etc? If yes, than activate the GiftBox. Still errors? Continue below.

[b]Q:[/b]     I see this, what is wrong.
xx:xx:xx Giftbox loading... 
xx:xx:xx Updating Giftbox 
xx:xx:xx UP GB Error: BAD AMF Response
[b]A:[/b]	If this does not happen to offten, leave it. 
or you have many items on your farm .
The GiftBox Plug-in is not able to read you farm. Fix your farm.

[b]Q:[/b]    The Plug-in show “Add to selling” but the item is already in the selling list.
[b]A:[/b]    Remove all .sqlite files from the plug-in folder (\Plugin\GiftBox\*.sqlite) and configure the settings again. There was something gone wrong with the upgrade.

[b]Q:[/b]    I see error xx:xx:xx Error: 500/ISE
[b]A:[/b]    This is not related to the Plug-in. Follow the clues on the forum to fix this error.

[b]Q:[/b]    When "enable images on other tabs" is ticked the GiftBox settings disappears
[b]A:[/b]    Wait, loading all the images will take some time. Just wait.
If you can not access the GUI anymore, Remove all .sqlite files from the plug-in folder (\Plugin\GiftBox\*.sqlite) and configure the settings again. 

[b]Q:[/b]    Will the fuel be sold or used?
[b]A:[/b]    That is what you configure in the “Consume” tab.

[b]Q:[/b]    I get this:**** ERROR: GiftBox manager Requires px_parser version v### or higher ****, what do I need to do?
[b]A:[/b]    Upgrade the parser.php file (or the newest bot most of the time include this)

[b]Q:[/b]    I have set “The amount of collection to leave in the game” to 1. But it leaves more.
[b]A:[/b]    Yes, it will leave for every collection 1 in the game.

[b]Q:[/b]    Images do not show.
[b]A:[/b]    The Images need to be downloaded from the farmvile server. This is no longer done by the Giftbox, but by the parser. complain there if the images are not downloaded

[b]Q:[/b]    Can the collections trade in be published on facebook?
[b]A:[/b]    Yes, use the PX_links for that.

[b]Q:[/b]    What can I do with: "amount of columns in the tabs to be shown?"
[b]A:[/b]    This will set the amount of column that is shown in the other tabs (only visual effect). Those of you that work on a big screen = 3. Perhaps on a width screen can be set 4 or higher.

[b]Q:[/b]   I see error: “Warning: Variable passed to each() is not an array”. What can I do.
[b]A:[/b]    Likely the downloading of the Giftbox content went wrong. Restart the bot. If this is persistent and you do not have other error (as mentioned in these Q&A) post it to the forum.

[b]Q:[/b]    I have this error, what can I do?
xx:xx:xx 1 consume_arborists Arborists ready for use 
xx:xx:xx Use consume_arborists result: 28 onUse failed for this consumable [0 to go] 
xx:xx:xx result: BAD AMF REPLY (OOS?) 
[b]A:[/b]    You can not USE or consume the Arborist; keep it or sell it.

[b]Q:[/b]    I can not see the GiftBox tab in the BOT.
[b]A:[/b]    Read the installation instructions.

[b]Q:[/b]    I still do not see the GiftBox tab in the BOT.
[b]A:[/b]    Make sure that the path is: C:\farmvillebot\plugins\GiftBox\main.php or C:\farmvillebot2.1\plugins\GiftBox\main.php 

[b]Q:[/b]    I still have an Error, shall I send you a PM?
[b]A:[/b]    NO.

[b]Q:[/b]    I like the plugin, can I make a donation?
[b]A:[/b]    Yes, see the first post in this tread

[b]Q:[/b]    I still have an Error, what can I do?
