Sections
2.3.0

Allows user to define 'sections' on one's farm, where a specific type of seed,
or a specific pattern of seeds is planted. In order to do this, control is taken
before planting, and sections are planted before returning control to parser.php.

Plots not in sections are untouched by this plugin and will follow the normal
seed list, plots in sections will ignore seed list, and will not cause the seed
count to count down. Superplots in sections will be seeded with section seed.
